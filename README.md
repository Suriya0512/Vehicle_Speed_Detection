# 🚗 Vehicle Speed Detection System

## 📌 Abstract

The Vehicle Speed Detection System is a computer vision–based application used to detect and measure the speed of moving vehicles in real time. A camera is used to capture traffic video, and image processing techniques are applied to detect vehicles and track their movement across frames.

The speed of each vehicle is calculated using distance and time. The system can identify over-speed vehicles and display their speed instantly. This project helps in traffic monitoring, accident prevention, and improving road safety.
